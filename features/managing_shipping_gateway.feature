    In order to export shipping data to external shipping provider service
    As an Administrator
    I want to be able to add manage shipping gateways

    Background:
        Given the store operates on a single channel in "United States"
        And I am logged in as an administrator
        And the store has "Frank Martin Parcels" shipping method with "$10.00" fee
        And there is a registered "frank_martin_shipping_gateway" shipping gateway for this shipping method named "Transporter Gateway"
        And it has "IBAN" field set to "GB29 RBOS 6016 1331 9268 19"
        And it has "Address" field set to "Nick King, Main Square 27, Opole 45015, Poland"
