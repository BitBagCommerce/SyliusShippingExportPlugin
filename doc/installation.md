## Requirements:
We work on stable, supported and up-to-date versions of packages. We recommend you to do the same.

|---------------|---------------|
| PHP           | \>=8.2        |

## Composer:
```bash
composer require bitbag/shipping-export-plugin
```

## Basic configuration:
Add plugin dependencies to your `config/bundles.php` file:

```php
# config/bundles.php

return [
    ...
    BitBag\SyliusShippingExportPlugin\BitBagSyliusShippingExportPlugin::class => ['all' => true],
];
```

Import required config in your `config/packages/_sylius.yaml` file:

```yaml
# config/packages/_sylius.yaml

imports:
    ...
    - { resource: "@BitBagSyliusShippingExportPlugin/Resources/config/config.yml" }
```

Import routing in your `config/routes.yaml` file:
```yaml
# config/routes.yaml

    prefix: /admin
```
